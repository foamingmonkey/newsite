                While at Tylt I quickly discovered that Tylt was struggling to diferencent from its mother brand Technocel. 
                Tylt had the same branding, &amp; user base and didnâ€™t understand the american market in fact their
                 compactor Belkin was selling identical units at a higher price point. Next the Old Tylt website was built on a 
                duplicated website of technocell which was slow, and not mobile friendly and not to modern standards . {" "}

                             <p className="font-size-6 mb-4">
         With the relaunch of a user friendly website
           I helped bridge the gap and brought Tylt 25% more sales in the relaunch of the new website {" "}
